Project timeline for **Assist Capacity Exchange Development**

# Project title:
Assist Capacity Exchange Development

## Brief summary:

The Capacity Exchange (CapX) is a project developing a sociotechnical platform for peer-to-peer connection and knowledge sharing towards sustainable, community-based capacity-building within the Wikimedia Movement. It intends to deliver an interactive, online platform, backed by a database, which will allow wikimedians to: publish information about themselves, their affiliates, and informal groups; conduct searches and access information published by others; connect with peers for knowledge exchange. The platform is intended to be responsive, intuitive, and accessible to all wikimedia users.

## Suggestions for CapX Platform Development

1. **User-Centric Design:** Prioritize user experience and ensure that the platform is user-friendly and intuitive. Conduct user research and gather feedback from potential users to understand their needs and preferences.

2. **Responsive Web Design:** Make sure the platform is accessible and responsive across different devices and screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. This will ensure that users can access and interact with the platform from anywhere.

3. **Robust Database Backend:** Design a well-structured and scalable database backend to store user profiles, affiliate information, and other relevant data. Consider using a suitable database management system like MySQL or PostgreSQL to ensure data integrity and efficient querying.

4. **Secure Authentication and Authorization:** Implement secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms to protect user accounts and sensitive information. Consider using industry-standard authentication protocols and encryption techniques.

5. **Effective Search Functionality:** Develop a powerful search feature that allows users to easily find relevant information and connect with peers. Implement filtering options, sorting capabilities, and an intuitive search interface to enhance the search experience.

6. **Social Interaction Features:** Enable users to engage in social interactions within the platform. This can include features such as private messaging, public discussions, and collaboration spaces to foster knowledge sharing and community building.

7. **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the platform's performance to ensure fast loading times and smooth user experience. Implement caching mechanisms, minimize database queries, and optimize code to enhance overall performance.

8. **Continuous Integration and Deployment:** Set up a CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Deployment) pipeline to automate the testing, building, and deployment processes. This will help streamline development cycles and ensure a stable and reliable platform.

9. **Documentation and Support:** Provide comprehensive documentation and support resources for users and developers. This will assist users in navigating the platform and enable developers to contribute effectively to the project.

10. **Community Engagement:** Involve the Wikimedia community throughout the development process. Seek feedback, incorporate suggestions, and encourage community participation to ensure that the platform aligns with the needs and values of the Wikimedia Movement.
